# Easy Testing

This is replacement for local computer testing for testing js-piscine solutions (not made for DOM manipulation).

## How to use

1. Take the tests folder and put it in your piscine folder where you have rest of your js-piscine files.
2. Copy files `.gitignore` and `tests.mjs` to your piscine folder.
3. Now write a solution to a new file, for example `pick-omit.js`.
4. Run `node tests.mjs` to test your solution.

That's all that is required. You do not need to write 2 extra arguments. You do not need an external location of your tests folder.
You do not need to specify the file or name of exercise you need to be tested. It automatically tests the last saved .js file in your piscine/current folder.

You do not need to go to test folder and run `node test.js` with 2 arguments.

## Here is a small demo picture of the file structure

I made a small **youtube video** also (sorry for no audio but I hope the video is good enough).
